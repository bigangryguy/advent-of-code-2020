# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions in [Go](https://golang.org) for the problems in the 2020 edition of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

Since I use each year's edition of the AOC to freshen up old skills I haven't used in a while, or learn brand-new 
skills, there is no guarantee to the quality of the code. But I do try my best.

Feel free to copy, make fun of, and otherwise use the code. Just don't claim it's yours.
